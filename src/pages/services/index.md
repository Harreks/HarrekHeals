## Intro

This is a list of all the extra things i can work on and services i offer. My primary goal is helping people and building tools for the community but as time is limited i inevitably have to charge for it at some point. I don't want money to get in the way of people getting help so even if you can't or don't want to pay for it please message me anyway if you want me to take a look at something, i am always happy to chat and assist in whatever way possible.

For everything that is done via written text you can assume a $15 USD cost per session, calls or videos would go up to $40 USD per session. I prefer to list these as *per session* rather than *per hour* because i don't want complex issues to go unresolved for the sake of taking less time. And once again i don't want money to get in the way of helping people so if you want to pay but these prices seem too high for you you should contact me anyway (and if you feel like the sessions are worth more than that i won't stop you either).

If you just want to support me and all the things i work on while also having a more direct line with me, consider supporting me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/harrek) instead.
